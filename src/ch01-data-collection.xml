      <title>Smoker's IQ</title>
      <p>
	A study was conducted in which 20,211 18--year old
	recruits were given an exam to measure IQ. In addition,
	the recruits were asked to disclose their smoking
	status. An individual was considered a smoker if he
	smoked at least 1 cigarette per day. The goal of the
	study was to determine whether adolescents aged 18 to 21
	who smoke have a lower IQ than nonsmokers. It was found
	that the average IQ of the smokers was 94, while the
	average IQ of nonsmokers was 101. The researchers
	concluded that lower IQ individuals are more likely to
	chose to smoke, not that smoking makes people less
	intelligent.

      <title>Four Tickets for Friends</title>

      <statement>
	<p>
	  Sophia has 10 friends that she would like to invite to a
	  concert, but only 4 tickets to give away.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Mike, Jamie, Adam, Yvette, Ashley, Monica, Cherie,
	  Julie, Willard, Bruce
	</p>
      </statement>

      <exercise>
	Which of the following would produce a simple random
	sample of the 4 friends that she will bring with her:

	<ol>
	  <li>
	    List each persons name on a piece of paper,
	    place them in a hat and draw 4.
	    <answer>yes</answer>
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    List the names in alphabetical order and take the
	    first 4 names.
	    <answer>no</answer>
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    Ask one of her friends who she should bring.
	    <answer>no</answer>
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    Number the friends from 1 to 10 and use a random
	    number generator to produce 4 numbers between 1 and
	    10 which correspond to the 10 friends.
	    <answer>yes</answer>
	  </li>
	</ol>
      </exercise>

      <exercise>
	Use the TI graphing calculator to obtain a random sample
	of the 4 friends that she will bring with her and give
	their names.
	<solution>
	  <!-- <cd> -->
	  <!--   randIntNoRep(1,10,4) -->

	  <p>
	    Thus she would invite Mike, Yvette, Ashley and
	    Julie.

    <title>Other Effective Sampling Methods</title>

    <definition>
      <title>stratified sampling</title>
      <statement>
	a simple random sample is drawn from each nonoverlapping
	subgroup (or <term>stratum</term>) into which the
	population has been separated.
      </statement>
      <p>
	Works best when individuals in each stratum are similar
	in some way and we want to make sure each stratum type
	is represented. The size of each simple random sample is
	proportional to the number of individuals in the stratum
	from which it is selected. (<eg /> separating
	individuals into age groups)
      </p>
    </definition>

    <definition>
      <title>systematic sampling</title>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  a starting point, <m>p</m>, is randomly selected and then every
	  <m>k</m>th subject is included in the sample, where
	  <md>
	    <mrow>k = \lfloor N/n \rfloor</mrow>.
	  </md>
	  The brackets, <m>\lfloor x \rfloor</m>, mean round
	  <m>x</m> down to the nearest integer, or take the
	  <term>floor</term> of <m>x</m>.

	  Subjects in the sample are numbered:
	  <md>
	    <mrow>p, p+k, p+2k, p+3k, \ldots, p+(n-1)k</mrow>
	  </md>
	</p>
	<p>
	  Works best when individuals are arranged sequentially
	  but you’re not sure how many total individuals there
	  are because you don’t have a frame of the population
	  (<eg /> files in a drawer, people coming out of a
	  building exit polling, <etc />).
	</p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <definition>
      <title>cluster sampling</title>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  the population is divided into sections or
	  <term>clusters</term>; all individuals from randomly
	  selected clusters are included in the sample.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Works best when individuals are grouped geographically
	  so it makes logistical sense to sample this way, but
	  location does not affect your variable of interest;
	  clusters are heterogeneous like the population.
	</p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <definition>
      <title>convenience sampling</title>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  sampling subjects who are easy to get (bad sampling
	  method).
	</p>
	<p>
	  Works best when: NEVER!! (not random)
	</p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <definition>
      <title>self-selected sampling</title>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  a convenience sample where individuals are
	  self-selected (another bad sampling method).
	</p>
	<p>
	  Works best when: NEVER!! (not random, favors those
	  with stronger opinions)
	</p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <definition>
      <title>multi-stage sampling</title>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  a sample that is selected in multiple stages, each of
	  which might use a different method of sampling.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Works best when: The population is organized
	  hierarchically but no list exists.
