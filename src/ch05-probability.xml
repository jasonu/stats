    <definition>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  <term>Probability</term> is the measure of the likelihood of
	  a random phenomenon or chance behavior occurring.
	</p>
	<p>
	  It deals with <term>experiments</term> that yield random
	  short-term results or <term>outcomes</term> yet reveal
	  long-term predictability.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The long-term proportion in which a certain outcome is
	  observed is the probability of that outcome.

      <title>Law of Large Numbers</title>
      <statement>

	  As the number of repetitions of a probability experiment

      <title>Simulating Coin Flips on the TI-84 Plus
      Calculator</title>

      <p>
	Probability is closely related to performing experiments.
	However, it is often tedious and time-consuming to perform an
	experiment by hand. For example, it would be tedious to roll a
	pair of dice 1000 times and record all the data, but if we
	program a computer to simulate the experiment we can often get
	results in a fraction of the time it would take to do the
	experiment the old fashioned way. Another side benefit of
	computer simulation is that you can easily share the computer
	code with others, so they can simulate your experiment as
	well, and perhaps even improve it.
      </p>

      <p>
	The following program written in TI-84 BASIC will simulate the
	flipping of a coin to demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers.
      </p>

      </figure>

      <p>
	When run (executed), the program does the following:
	<ol>
	  <li>
	    Clears lists 1, 2 and 3.
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    Prompts you for a number, <c>N</c>, which is the number of
	    coin flips to perform.
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    Generates <c>N</c>, 0's or 1's (pseudo-randomly) and saves
	    the results in list 1. (0=tails, 1=heads)
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    Initialize an accumulator variable, <c>A</c>, to 0.
	    <c>A</c> will keep track of the total number of heads.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      Set <c>I=1</c> (<c>I</c> for <q>index</q>) then for each
	      coin flip:
	      <ul>
		<li>Add the coin value to <c>A</c>,</li>
		<li>
		  Store the value of <c>I</c> into list 2,
		</li>
		<li>
		  Store the current proportion of heads, <c>A/I</c>
		  into list 3.
		</li>
	      </ul>
	      Increment <c>I</c> by 1. Exit the loop if <c>I &gt;
	      N</c>, otherwise repeat the loop.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	</ol>
      </p>

      <p>
	After running the COINFLIP program, you can examine the output
	it generated by viewing the data in lists 1, 2 and 3. The
	ideal way to examine the data however is to create a
	<term>scatter plot</term> using lists 2 and 3. The following
	<c>STAT PLOT</c> screen shows you how to plot the output of
	the COINFLIP program.
      </p>

	  STAT PLOT settings to generate a scatter plot of the
	  COINFLIP output.

	<image source="images/coinflip-statplot.png" width="50%" />
      </figure>
      <p>
	Finally by pressing <c>zoom</c> and then choosing
	<c>9:ZoomStat</c> you can generate a plot similar to the two
	scatter plots below, each of which represents <c>N=50</c> coin
	flips. The <m>x</m>-axis of the scatter plot is the coin flip
	number, while the <m>y</m>-axis is the proportion of flips
	which are heads. Notice that as the number of flips increases
	the proportion of heads generally gets closer to 0.5 or 50%.
	This is precisely what the Law of Large Numbers implies.

      Before the advent of computers, probability was typically
      studied in a different way which we will label the <q>Classical
      Approach</q>, as opposed to the experimental or <q>Empirical
      Approach</q> to the study of probability. We will need some new
      vocabulary in order to discuss the classical approach.

    <definition>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  The <term>sample space</term>, <m>S</m>, of a probability
	  experiment is the collection, or set of all possible
	  outcomes.
	</p>
	<p>
	  An <term>event</term> is any collection of outcomes from a
	  probability experiment. Thus an event is a subset of a
	  sample space. It is common to denote events with capital
	  letters such as <m>E, F, G, E_1, E_1, \ldots, E_n</m>
	  <etc/>.

      <title><q>Spaces</q> in Mathematics</title>
      <p>
	It is common in mathematics to use the word <q>space</q> to
	mean set. The reason for using a different word is because,
	sets have no structure, whereas a <q>space</q> is a set
	equipped with some additional structure.

      <p>
	When you roll a pair of six-sided dice, what is the
	probability of rolling a five?
      </p>

      <p>
	<em>Empirical Approach: </em> We could roll a pair of
	dice say 30 times and record the number of 5's we get. The
	probability of rolling a 5 on any subsequent roll is then
	approximated by:
      </p>

      <p>
	<me>
	  P(5) = \frac{\text{number of 5s}}{30}
	</me>
      </p>

      <p>
	<em>Classical Approach</em> We can enumerate or list
	<em>all</em> possible outcomes of rolling a pair of dice.

	There are exactly 36 possible outcomes all of equal
	likelihood. Only four of the outcomes: (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), or
	(4, 1) result in a total of five. Thus since there are four

    <remark>
      <p>
	Knowing two events are <term>disjoint</term> means that the
	events are <term>dependent</term>. Why? Consider the example
	of pulling chips numbered 0-9 out of a bag. Suppose event
	<m>E</m> corresponds with pulling a chip labelled with a 1 or
	a 2 out of the bag, <ie/> <m>E=\{1,2\}</m> and suppose
	<m>F=\{3,4\}</m>, <ie/> <m>F</m> corresponds with pulling a 3
	or 4 chip out of the bag. Notice that these events are
	<term>disjoint</term> because they have no outcomes in common.
	Finally, notice that if we know that event <m>E</m> occurred
	(a 1 or 2 is drawn), then we know for certain that <m>F</m>
	(drawing a 3 or 4) did <em>not</em> occur. Thus the occurrence
	of <m>E</m> affects the probability of event <m>F</m> and vice
	versa.
