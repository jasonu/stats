    <definition>
      <title>Mean (Arithmetic Average)</title>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  The <term>mean</term> or <term>arithmetic average</term> is
	  computed by adding up all the values and dividing by the
	  number of observations.
	</p>
	<dl width="wide">
	  <li>
	    <title>population mean</title>
	      <m>\mu = \dfrac{\sum x_i}{N}</m>

	<p>
	  Note that it is a convention in Statistics to use Greek
	  letters to represent population statistics while we use
	  Roman letters to denote sample statistics.
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    <alert>Advantage:</alert> the mean is used as a starting
	    point for computing several other useful statistics <eg/>
	    std. deviation.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <alert>Disadvantage:</alert> If the data is skewed or
	    contains outliers, then the mean is not the best way to
	    measure the center of your data.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <definition>
      <title>Median</title>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  The <term>median</term> or <term>middle value</term> is the
	  value that lies in the middle of the data when the data is
	  arranged in ascending order. Notation: <m>M</m>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Algorithm:
	  <ol>
	    <li>Sort the data, from least to greatest.</li>
	    <li>Find the single middle element, or middle two elements
	    if the list has an even number of elements.</li>
	    <li>If there is one value in the middle (<m>n</m> odd),
	    then that value is the median. If there are two values in
	    the middle (<m>n</m> even) then the median is the average
	    of the two middle values.</li>
	  </ol>
	</p>
	<p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      <alert>Advantage:</alert> Resistant to outliers and or
	      skewed data.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <alert>Disadvantage:</alert> Hard to compute by hand
	      when you have a large data set.
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <example>
      <title>Computing the Median By Hand I</title>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  Find the median of the list: 3, 4, 2, 6, 3.
	</p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
	<p>
	  The ordered list is: 2, 3, 3, 4, 6, and the middle value is
	  3, thus <m>M=3</m>.
	</p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <example>
      <title>Computing the Median By Hand II</title>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  Find the median of the list: 3, 4, 2, 6, 3, 7
	</p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
	<p>
	  The ordered list is: 2, 3, 3, 4, 6, 7, but it has an even
	  number of elements, so we compute the average or mean of the
	  middle two elements, thus the median is:
	  <md>
	    <mrow>
	      M = \frac{3+4}{2} = 3.5
	    </mrow>
	  </md>
	</p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <definition>
      <title>Resistant</title>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  A statistic is said to be <term>resistant</term> if extreme
	  values do not affect the value of the statistic.
	</p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <definition>
      <title>Mode</title>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  The <term>mode</term> is the most frequently occuring
	  observation in a data set. A single data set may have
	  multiple modes.
	</p>
      </statement>

      <title>Working Hours</title>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  A random sample of 25 college students was asked, <q>How

      <exercise>
	<statement>
	  <p>
	    Determine the distribution of the hours worked by creating
	    a frequency histogram on your TI-84 Plus calculator. Use 0
	    as your lower class limit and 5 as your class width.
	  </p>
	</statement>
	<answer>
	  <p>
	    First enter the data into any list, press <c>window</c>
	    and enter the following values:
	    <ul>
	      <li>Xmin=0</li>
	      <li>Xmax=45</li>
	      <li>Xscl=5</li>
	      <li>Ymin=0</li>
	      <li>Ymax=10</li>
	      <li>Yscl=2</li>
	    </ul>
	    Finally after choosing the correct list in STAT PLOT press
	    <c>graph</c> to plot the histogram with the above
	    settings.
	  </p>
	  <image

	</answer>
      </exercise>
      <exercise>
	<statement>
	  <p>
	    Use your graphing calculator to find the mean and median.
	    Which measure better describes the hours worked?
	  </p>
	</statement>
	<answer>
	  <sidebyside>
	    <image
		source="images/hours-worked-mean.png"
		width="40%" />
	    <image
		source="images/hours-worked-median.png"
		width="40%" />
	  </sidebyside>
	  <p>
	    <ul>
	      <li><m>\bar{x} = 26.64</m></li>
	      <li><m>M = 30</m></li>
	    </ul>
	     Because the data is skewed to the left, the median is a
	     better measure of the central tendency of the data.

	  A <term>z-score</term> of a data point is the number of

      <title>Comparing Final Exam Scores</title>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  Final exam scores for a Biology course have a mean of 79 and
	  a standard deviation of 5. Final exam scores for a
	  Statistics course have a mean of 82 and a standard deviation
	  of 7. You scored 86 on the Biology exam and 91 on the
	  Statistics exam. How many standard deviations above the mean
	  were you in each course? Relative to the rest of the
	  students, on which exam did you do better?
	</p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
	<tabular top="major">
	  <row bottom="major">
	    <cell halign="right">statistic</cell>
	    <cell halign="center">symbol</cell>
	    <cell halign="center">Biology</cell>
	    <cell halign="center">Statistics</cell>

	</tabular>
	<p>
	  Thus since, 1.4 &gt; 1.3, you did slightly better on the
	  Biology exam than you did on your Statistics exam, relative
	  to your fellow students. This is despite the fact that in
	  absolute terms, your score in Statistics was higher.
	</p>
	<p>
	  This example demonstrates that it is meaningless to compare
	  absolute measures which come from different distributions,
	  in this case, the test scores. However, by rescaling each
	  test score relative to the mean and the standard deviation
	  of each distribution <ie/> creating z-scores, we can
	  meaningfully compare data from different distributions.

      <title>Triathlon Times</title>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  Roberto finishes a triathlon (750 m swim, 5 km run, and 20
	  km bicycle) in 63.2 minutes. Among all men in the race, the
	  mean finishing time was 69.4 minutes with a standard
	  deviation of 8.0 minutes. Zandra finishes the same triathlon
	  in 79.3 minutes. Among all women in the race, the mean
	  finishing time was 84.7 minutes with a standard deviation of
	  7.4 minutes. Who did better relative to their gender?
	</p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
	<p>
	  We compute a z-score for each athlete:
	</p>
	<tabular top="major">
	  <row bottom="minor">
	    <cell halign="right">statistic</cell>
	    <cell halign="center">Roberto</cell>
	    <cell halign="center">Zandra</cell>
	  </row>
	  <row bottom="minor">
	    <cell halign="right">z-score</cell>
	    <cell halign="center"><m>\dfrac{63.2-69.4}{8.0}</m></cell>
	    <cell halign="center"><m>\dfrac{79.3-84.7}{7.4}</m></cell>
	  </row>
	  <row bottom="major">
	    <cell halign="right">z-score</cell>
	    <cell halign="center">-0.775</cell>
	    <cell halign="center"><m>\approx</m> -0.730</cell>
	  </row>
	</tabular>
	<p>
	  In the case of a race, it is better to have a time below the
	  mean time of all the racers, thus the more negative the
	  z-score the better. Since Roberto has the lower z-score,
	  Roberto did better relative to his competitors than Zandra
	  did relative to hers.
