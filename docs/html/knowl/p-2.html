<p>Studying these lecture notes alone is usually not sufficient to achieve an A grade in the course. You should prepare for each lecture by reading the section we will cover each day before coming to class. Do not feel you need to read each section extremely carefully. If you get stuck while reading, spend a few minutes trying to figure out your misunderstanding, but if you can't figure it out, make a mental note of your question (or better yet write it down) and then continue on in the section. Often when reading mathematics, you will find that your question gets answered a few sentences or paragraphs later.</p>
