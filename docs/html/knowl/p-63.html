<p>Are young couples who marry or cohabit more likely to gain weight than those who stay single? Researchers followed 8000 men and women for 7 years. At the start of the study, none of the participants were married or living with a romantic partner. The researchers found that women who married or cohabited during the study period gained 9 pounds more then single women, and married or cohabiting men gained, on average, 6 pounds more than single men.</p>
