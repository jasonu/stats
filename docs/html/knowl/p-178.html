<p>Probability is closely related to performing experiments. However, it is often tedious and time-consuming to perform an experiment by hand. For example, it would be tedious to roll a pair of dice 1000 times and record all the data, but if we program a computer to simulate the experiment we can often get results in a fraction of the time it would take to do the experiment the old fashioned way. Another side benefit of computer simulation is that you can easily share the computer code with others, so they can simulate your experiment as well, and perhaps even improve it.</p>
