<p>A study was conducted in which 20,211 18--year old recruits were given an exam to measure IQ. In addition, the recruits were asked to disclose their smoking status. An individual was considered a smoker if he smoked at least 1 cigarette per day. The goal of the study was to determine whether adolescents aged 18 to 21 who smoke have a lower IQ than nonsmokers. It was found that the average IQ of the smokers was 94, while the average IQ of nonsmokers was 101. The researchers concluded that lower IQ individuals are more likely to chose to smoke, not that smoking makes people less intelligent.</p>
